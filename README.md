**DOUGHMIX**
The app is for private use only. 
It helps to calculate the correct ingredients if you want to bake your own bread with sourdough.

You need to specify the bread size, the desired bread strength (measured in W for the Flour strength)
Important is to have always a bread with more than 300 W. 

The ingredients are calculated based on the flours, water content and salt content. 

Happy baking.
